<h1>STAR WARS CREATURES</h1>
<div class="crawltext"> 
<h2>George Lucas wrote the story that became Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977), creating characters like Darth Vader, Leia Organa & Luke Skywalker that became instant cultural icons.</h2>  
<h2>Besides Jedi, Sith & Rebels, Lucasâ€™ space opera also introduced audiences to banthas, dewbacks, mynocks & wampas.  These were some of the first creatures of the Star Wars universe, and helped make this galaxy believably futuristic and strange, but with echoes from our own world.</h2>    
<h2>Since then, the roster of creatures has exploded over the past 40+ years as the franchise expanded. This site showcases some of them and their roles in the saga........</h2>
