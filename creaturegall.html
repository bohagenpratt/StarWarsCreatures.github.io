			<p class="wampastories"><a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Wampa" target="blank">Wampas</a> were developed for The Empire Strikes Back's opening sequence on the ice plant Hoth, and according to Wookiepedia may have been inspired by legends of the Yeti or the Abominable Snowman.</p>
			<p>In a brief few scenes, a wampa captures Luke Skywalker as he patrols the outskirts of Echo Base and imprisons him in its cave, forcing Luke to call on the Force to escape.</p> 
			<p>But wampas had a bigger role in the original screenplay, in which a group of them attacked the Rebel base at the same time that Imperial troops arrived. One <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q8Ij3mnGjFQ" target="blank">deleted scene</a> shows wampas narrowly missing an encounter with Darth Vader himself!</p>

			<p class="banthastories"><a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/bantha" target="blank">Banthas</a> are massive, brown-haired quadrupeds that resemble wooly mammoths, with curly spiraling horns like bighorn sheep. In wild herds and also domesticated like cattle, they roam the deserts of Tattoine.</p>
			<p>Since Tattoine is a frequent setting in Star Wars, banthas appear in many movies and series, usually in the company of Sand People for whom they serve as mounts.</p>
			<p>First seen in A New Hope (1977), they were originally played by Mardji, a female Asian elephant. Mardji was draped in a costume of horsehair, chicken wire and palm fronds, the latter to create the bantha's fur.</p>
			<p>Despite their utility and gentle nature, "bantha" is often used as an insult, and also to describe futile errands</p>
